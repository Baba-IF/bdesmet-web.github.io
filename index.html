			special goal in the future i just really like coding then i've decided to create this website </p>
		<h3> Which language i would like to use ? </h3>
		<p> My goal in the future is to know about the most important language like ; </p>

		<ul>
			<li><strong> HTML </strong></li>
			<li><strong> CSS </strong></li>
			<li><strong> JS </strong></li>
			<li><strong> php </strong></li>
